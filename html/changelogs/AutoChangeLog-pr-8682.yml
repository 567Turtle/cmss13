  - rscadd: "Adds a gun durability and repair system."
  - rscadd: "A handful of bullets can be used to chamber a gun when it is unchambered, provided the caliber matches."
  - balance: "Guns can no longer be destroyed by small explosions; this functionality is hooked up with the gun durability system, but guns can still be deleted if the explosion is strong enough i.e. Orbital Bombardments."
  - balance: "Guns can no longer be deleted when acid is poured into it, instead requiring repairs. Zero durability weapons still get deleted if its acided, however."
